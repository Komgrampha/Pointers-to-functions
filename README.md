# Menu-Driven Program Using Pointers to Function Report

##Table of Contents

##Introduction
This report outlines how a menu-driven program is executed in C++ using the pointers to functions elements to perform different mathematical operations. A menu-driven program in the C++ programming language is a type of interactive software application that displays a menu of options and allows the user to choose from a list of actions or functionalities (Javatpoint, 2021). A function pointer in C++ is a variable that stores a function's address and point to executable code within a program. Function pointers are used to obtain the function's address (GeeksforGeeks, 2022). The program allow user to select the appropriate option in the interface or menu of the executed program, enter the numbers to receive the result of the chosen option and if the option is incorrect then it tells us to try again.

##Purpose

##Array of Pointers

##Implementation Process in the code

###Function Declaration

###Main Function

##Menu Display

##User Interaction and Execution

##Code used in the Program with Comments

##Conclusion
The menu-driven program demonstrates the use of pointers to functions in C++ and how to pass the pointers to functions. The program serves as the practical example of dynamic function execution based on the user input when the user selects the different available option for mathematical operation in the program it gives its expected result.
