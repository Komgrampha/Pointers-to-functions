# Menu-Driven Program Using Pointers to Function Report
This report outlines how a menu-driven program is executed in C++ using the pointers to functions elements to perform different mathematical operations. A menu-driven program in the C++ programming language is a type of interactive software application that displays a menu of options and allows the user to choose from a list of actions or functionalities (Javatpoint, 2021). A function pointer in C++ is a variable that stores a function's address and point to executable code within a program. Function pointers are used to obtain the function's address (GeeksforGeeks, 2022). The program allow user to select the appropriate option in the interface or menu of the executed program, enter the numbers to receive the result of the chosen option and if the option is incorrect then it tells us to try again.
#Purpose
• Declare an array of function pointers, each executing a separate mathematical operation.
• Design an interactive menu to show consumers possible options when the code is implemented.
• Prompt the user for a selection in the given option, then execute the associated function.
